```shell
#!/bin/bash

#. ./header.sh
#source ./header.sh

echo `date` # print date
printf "Hello, Shell\n"

echo "file：$0";
echo "parameter count: $#";
echo "parameter string: $*";
echo "first parameter：$1";
echo "second parameter：$2";
echo "file content" > filename

## print
user="Bendy Zhang"
age=100
readonly user
echo $user
echo "welcome ${user}"
echo "user length is ${#user}"
echo "cut string: ${user:1:4}"
printf "Hello, %-15s \n" $user   # Hello,    Bendy Zhang
unset age  # you can not unset readonly variable

## if then elif fi
num1=100
num2=100
if test $[num1] -eq $[num2]
then
    echo '=='
else
    echo '!='
fi

# LOOP
for file in `ls /etc`; do
  echo $file
done

for skill in Ada Coffe Action Java; do
    echo "I am good at ${skill}Script"
done

int=1
while(( $int<=5 ))
do
    echo $int
    let "int++"
done

## array
array_name=("bing" "zhang" 100 1)
array_name[0]="Bing"
array_name[3]="str"
echo ${array_name[@]} # print all elements
length=${#array_name[@]}  # array length
length=${#array_name[*]}  # array length

## expression
val=`expr 2 + 2`
echo "sum: $val"

## File (-e)
FILE=/tmp/foo.txt
if [ ! -f "$FILE" ]
then
    echo "File $FILE does not exist"
fi
DIR=/tmp/dir
if [ -d "$DIR" ]

fi
```

	echo "done."
	exit 1;
}

while getopts d:h: o; do
	case "$o" in
		d)
			DAY=${OPTARG}
			HAS_ARGS=true
			;;
		h)
			HOUR=${OPTARG}
			HAS_ARGS=true
			;;
	esac
done

shift $OPTIND-1

if !(${HAS_ARGS}); then
	usage
else
	echo "current date: "`date`
	d1=`date '+%m'`
	d2=`date '+%M%Y'`
	d="${d1}${DAY}${HOUR}${d2}"
	echo "set date to ${d}..."
	date $d
	echo "current date: "`date`
fi
```

```
./date.sh -d <day> [-h <hour>]
./date.sh   // sync date with <date server>
```
