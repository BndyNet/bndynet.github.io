## React 

### The Component Lifecycle

#### Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

- constructor()
- static getDerivedStateFromProps()
- render()
- componentDidMount()

#### Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

- static getDerivedStateFromProps()
- shouldComponentUpdate()
- render()
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
- componentDidUpdate()

#### Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

- componentWillUnmount()


#### Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

- static getDerivedStateFromError()
- componentDidCatch()


### [ISSUE: Push a new route only triggers URL change but not location change](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router/issues/159#issuecomment-433861157)

**keywords:** *connected-react-router*, *redux-saga*

**Reasons**: withRouter does not subscribe to location changes like React Reduxâ€™s connect does for state changes. Instead, re-renders after location changes propagate out from the <Router> component. This means that withRouter does not re-render on route transitions unless its parent component re-renders. If you are using withRouter to prevent updates from being blocked by shouldComponentUpdate, it is important that withRouter wraps the component that implements shouldComponentUpdate. So using withRouter to wrap connect to fix it. https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/withRouter

Things wrong:

- Using two different instances of history  
- Using both ConnectedRouter and BrowserRouter

Code to use **withRouter** and **connect** in App.tsx

```typescript
// as any to escape type checking in typescript 
export default withRouter(connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(withStyles(styles)(AppComponent)) as any);
```

## Material UI

### Reference defined styles (**$**)

```typescript
createStyles({
  ...variantColor(theme),
  root: {
    '&:hover $icon': {
      transform: 'scale(2.8)',
    },
  },
  icon: {
    transform: 'scale(2.5)',
  }
```

### Clone element, attach properties and check element type using TypeScript (**action: any**)

```typescript
const actions = [<h1 />, <IconButton><CloseIcon /></IconButton>];
actions.forEach((action: any, index) => {
  React.cloneElement(action, {
    key: `ACTION-${index}`,
    className: action.type === IconButton ? classes.headerToolboxButton : ''
  })
});
```

### Global styles for current page

```typescript
createStyles({
  '@global': {
    a: {
      color: 'inherit',
    },
    '.recharts-tooltip-label': {
      color: theme.palette.common.black,
    },
  },
});
```
